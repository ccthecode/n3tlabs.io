Is there an existing external adapter you would like for us to implement?


##### What is an external adapter?
External adapters allow additional flexibility to Chainlink Oracles such as querying API's that require authentication or 
performing additional operations on data before returning it on-chain. For more information on external adapters view  the [Chainlink documentation](https://blog.chain.link/build-and-use-external-adapters/) 

We have experience in creating custom external adapters. Whether it involves consuming data from an existing 3rd party API,
or creating an external adapter that computes data consumed from [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), we can create a custom solution to provided the necessary data on-chain.
